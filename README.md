LogSquirrel
===========

Regularly backup log files (any files for that matter!) from a cloud foundry app to a cloud storage provider of your choice.

1. Clone this application

  ``git clone git@github.com:danhigham/log_squirrel.git``  

2. Copy the example config to config.yml

  ``cd log_squirrel && cp config.yml.example config.yml``  
  
3. Tailor the config to suit your requirements

4. Deploy the application, using the handy script
